# azureTraining

Code coming from working through different Microsoft Learn curriculum.  Each script is named after the specific module followed by an incrementing number.  The scripts are meant to be executed in order.  The majority of the code is sourced from the Learn modules examples with modifications for the inclusion into a bash script.

Scripts are expected to be executed from the directory they are reside.  Other files used by the scripts are accessed based on that assumption.
